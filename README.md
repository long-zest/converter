convertToTimeStamp is function convertToExtChat using to convert BirthDate in ChatItems and Date in ShoppingItems from string to Timestamp types

# The questions
- How much time it took to complete or before stopping
-> It took me around 15-20 minutes to complete

- Your feelings about the test
-> It good, not really hard to be honest, still kinda hard to understand in the beginning, it took me like 5 minutes to read again and again to know what to do.

- What the lacking in the task definition
-> It not really have anything mention about Timestamp type so it make the task kinda confuse

- Is the solution complete or not? Is the solution optimized or is it via brute force?
-> The solution provied is complete and optimized. The code does not use any brute force approach, but rather a straightforward mapping of the internal data types to the external data types
